      <h2>Structure Your Information</h2>
         <p><em>The following QUIZ helps learners leverage core features according to best practices to future-proof their site architecture.</em></p>
         <fieldset>
            <legend>Quiz</legend>
            <p>DEMO: There are various ways to sketch a rough structure for your site. Popular methods include card sorting and paper prototyping. Getting early input from others can save you from extra work or problems down the line. Web Publishing's <a href="#">Card Sorting and Paper Prototyping</a> knowledge base article explains how to get through this important step quickly. Read it, try it, and then answer the following:</p>
            <p>What is the purpose of card sorting and prototyping exercises?</p>
            <p>
               <select>
                  <option disabled selected>Choose one</option>
                  <option>To arrange information logically</option>
                  <option>To discover things visitors need and expect from your site</option>
                  <option>To trust suggestions, despite your own convictions</option>
                  <option>All of the above</option>
               </select>
            </p>
            <p>DEMO: WordPress has automatic ways that it groups content and it also offers ways for you to group content how you see fit with customizable categories and tags. These breakdowns are officially referred to as "taxonomies" and the important differences between the two are covered in Web Publishing's <a href="#">Difference between categories and tags</a> article. Read it, try it, and then answer the following:</p>
            <p>Which taxonomy is best used to label very specific terms and keywords?</p>
            <p>
               <select>
                  <option disabled selected>Choose one</option>
                  <option>Categories</option>
                  <option>Tags</option>
                  <option>Media</option>
                  <option>Plugins</option>
               </select>
            </p>
